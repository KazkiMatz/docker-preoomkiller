# docker-preoomkiller
Watches container memory use and softly kills the container with SIGTERM before Docker does

## Dependencies

- Install Python 2 or 3 in your Docker image

## Install

With `curl`: put `RUN curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/izakp/docker-preoomkiller/master/install-preoomkiller.sh | sh` in your Dockerfile to install `preoomkiller` to `/usr/local/bin`

Manually `ADD` `preoomkiller` to your Docker image somewhere on your `$PATH`

## Use

In your container's init script run `preoomkiller` in the background with `exec /usr/local/bin/preoomkiller &`

`preoomkiller` is observed to use approximately 4Mb running on Python 2 and 6Mb running on Python 3

## Configuration options

`preoomkiller` won't start unless the environment variable `ENABLE_PREOOMKILLER` is set

`PREOOMKILLER_MEMORY_USE_FACTOR` - (float) at what percentage of used / total memory to kill the container (default `0.95`)

`PREOOMKILLER_POLL_INTERNAL` (integer) - how many seconds to wait beween polling memory use (default `10`)

`PREOOMKILLER_KILL_SIGNAL` (integer) - what signal to send to the process (default `SIGTERM` / `15`)

`PREOOMKILLER_KILL_PID` (integer) - what pid will receive a SIGTERM (default: the pid of the parent that spawned `preoomkiller`) If you don't start `preoomkiller` and your application's main process via an entrypoint script (see the example `docker-entrypoint.sh`) you can also set this to `1` to simply send the signal to the root process.  `preoomkiller` will exit after sending a signal or its parent process dies.  Note: make sure you're using an init system like [dumb-init](https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init) to make sure the pid 1 process properly proxies signals to children

## Testing
